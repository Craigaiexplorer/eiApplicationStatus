node js project with basic functionality to store application in sqlite db
Coded by Craig McCann craigmccann2010@gmail.com from the shared understanding developed in the Terrible Two's prototyping team brought together by the Canadian School of the Public Service Digital Academy.  Web page design was inspired by Kevin Love's prototypes.
requires nodejs and sqlite3 to be installed prior to running
These project was coded by a complete beginner to nodejs  most likely there are much better and easier ways to write nodejs and angular code to display these pages, but due to a 5 day development window I used what I remember from my js experiences.

There is no data entry rules or checks, and there are no rules on the database fields other than datatype.  The database is no where near third normal form.

the nodejs package wasn't created correctly so follow the instructions in the instructionsStatusApp file for additional npm package installations.

recommend moving to a mean stack implementation and hashing all of the data entered so less chance of a data breach being able to expose applicant data.
